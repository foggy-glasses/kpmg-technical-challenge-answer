### Answer

Rather copy-paste the script that would do this, I found a python script at https://github.com/bluprince13/aws-metadata-json that would do this job.
It queries the AWS instance meta data and provides a JSON formatted ouput. Additionally, it also allows retrieving the value for a key supplied.
